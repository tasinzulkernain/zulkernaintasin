## 2. Education

### **Master of Business Administration (MBA) – Deep-tech Entrepreneurship**
*Vilnius University Business School, Vilnius, Lithuania* | *09/2024 – 01/2026*
* **Final Grade:** 7.89 / 10
* **Master’s Thesis:** "DeepTech Entrepreneurship in Contrasting Ecosystems: A Comparative Analysis of Lithuania and Bangladesh."
    * **Research Scope:** Investigated "Institutional Voids" (Emerging Markets) vs. "Institutional Glut" (EU) to determine why startups fail. Analyzed the "Valley of Death" in financing and the "Compliance Wall" in regulation.
    * **Methodology:** Conducted qualitative comparative analysis using a "Most Different Systems Design" (MDSD). Developed "FinAss," a conceptual AI FinTech vignette, to stress-test user trust and regulatory viability (GDPR, AI Act).
    * **Stakeholder Engagement:** Secured and conducted high-level interviews with 8 experts, including the **Former Minister of Education of Lithuania** (Jurgita Petrauskienė), Board Chairmen of **State-Owned Enterprises (EPSO-G)**, and CEOs of major tech firms (CyberCare).
    * **Key Outcome:** Developed strategic "Playbooks" for CEOs to navigate "Permission-Based" (EU) vs. "Construction-Based" (Global South) ecosystems.

### **Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) – Robotics & Mechatronics Engineering**
*University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh* | *01/2016 – 01/2020*
* **CGPA:** 3.11 / 4.00
* **Thesis:** "Quadcopter Flying and Walking Mechanism using Same Limbs."
    * **Innovation:** Designed a hybrid **X8 Coaxial Quadcopter** capable of transforming flight wings into walking legs to access hazardous environments (fire zones, underground tunnels).
    * **Engineering Specs:** Integrated 8 **Brushless DC Motors** (DJI 2212 920KV) and 16 **MG995 Servo Motors** for 3-DOF limb movement. Controlled by dual **Arduino Mega** microcontrollers and an **APM 2.8 Flight Controller** with **MPU6050 Gyroscopes** and **ADXL345 Accelerometers**.
    * **Aerodynamics:** Applied **Glauert’s Theory** to calculate thrust efficiency for the coaxial propulsion system.
    * **Problem Solving:** Overcame initial structural failure ("Same Limb" crash due to servo torque limits) by engineering a revised "Separate Limb" chassis, successfully demonstrating walking and object-grabbing capabilities.
