# Hi there, I'm Zulkernain Tasin 👋

### 🚀 Robotics Engineer | DeepTech Strategist | Operations Specialist

I am a multidisciplinary engineer and entrepreneur bridging the gap between **hardware innovation**, **regulatory compliance**, and **operational excellence**. 

I hold an **MBA in Deep-tech Entrepreneurship** from **Vilnius University** (2026) and a **B.Sc. in Mechatronics** from the **University of Dhaka**. My work focuses on solving complex "Product-Market Fit" challenges in contrasting ecosystems—from engineering hybrid UAVs in South Asia to optimizing support operations for NordVPN.
